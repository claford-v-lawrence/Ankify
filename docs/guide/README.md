# Introduction

Ankify allows you to convert your markdown notes into Anki cards. By using a predefined template as the container for the front of the card, the content that comes after become the back of the card. 

Hereâ€™s an example card in markdown format:

![image-20200818212923975](images/image-20200818212923975.png)

The text within `<!--` and `-->` becomes the front of the card, while the bullet points that come after become the back of the card. When you run Ankify, it generates an html file. You can then import the file into Anki. This would become the result card:
