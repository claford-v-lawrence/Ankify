# Anterolateral System

{{3 modalities of Anterolateral system. What is used to test ALS. What is spinal level}}

![](Pain and Temperature/Slide2.JPG)

- pain: not a needle, just a pin prick
- temperature: not usually tested
- crude touch: not discriminative. ==You just know something's== happening; also itch, tickle, etc.
- spinal level: slang for lowest dermatome level where pinprick is still intact. E.g. sensory lvl of T6 has sensation intact down to T6 but not below

# Spinothalamic tract

## Modality

{{ignore}}

## Tract

{{spinothalamic tr. overview, neurons, tracts, final destiny}}

![](Pain and Temperature/Slide5.JPG)

- Enter cord and ascend 1-2 segments right away in dorsal horn known as Lissauer's tract

{{spinothalamic tr. synapse and enkephalinergic interneurons in spinal cord}}

![](Pain and Temperature/Slide7.JPG)

- C and A delta synapse in lamina 1, where enkephalin mediated inhibition occur
- Know Substantia gelatinosa, where **enkephalingeic interneurons** are

## Histology

{{Spinothalamic tr. histology}}

### Lower Cervical

![](https://i.imgur.com/YiaWE5G.jpg)

- most distal sacral, most medial for upper extremity
- In lesions, sacral will be last dermatome to be affected (saddle)
- central lesion at ant. white commissure can have bilateral results

### Caudal Medulla

### Caudal Pons

### Midbrain

### Thalamus

- same as DCML

# Spinoreticular pathway

{{spinoreticular pathway mediates, overview, neurons and tracts}}

![](https://i.imgur.com/XCdxKv7.jpg)

- mediates emotional reaction to pain
- spinoreticular, reticulothalamic, thalamocortical tracts

## Histology

{{spinoreticular tr. histology}}

- spinoreticular

# Spinomesencephalic tr

{{spinomesencephalic tr. ascending overview, function, neurons, tracts, fibers}}

![](https://i.imgur.com/aRUPCvZ.jpg)

- pain input activates co pathway (spinomesencephalic) that leads to descending neurons that limit pain

## Histology

{{spinomesencephalic tr. ascending pathway histology}}

- Periaquaductal gray

![](https://i.imgur.com/bpJaqyA.png)



![](https://i.imgur.com/n5cWQ3J.jpg)

- spinomesencephalic synapse on small PAG interneurons that produce peptides
- activation of descending Glutaminergic neurons, descend to lower levels of brainstem


## Descending pathway

{{spinomesencephalic tr. descending pathway. What are 2 pathways. Where does the final inhibition happen}}

![](https://i.imgur.com/ySHtgP6.jpg)

- NE and seratonergic pathways

![](https://i.imgur.com/i1lDyIP.jpg)

- All happening in dorsal horn and substantia gelatinosa

{{3 CNS sites where opioid peptides operate for pain}}

![](https://i.imgur.com/zXN103V.png)

## Descending NE Mechanism

{{descending NE mechanism pathway, neuron, MOA, and result}}

![](https://i.imgur.com/l1hLRQp.jpg)

- activates the only NE neuron in the brain
- axoaxonic synnapse and inhibit presynaptic neurons
- result: gates K+ efflux = hyperpolarized presynapse = harder to depolarize
- location of action for low dose tricyclic antidepressants

## Descending Serotonergic Mechanism

{{Descending serotonergic mechanism pathway, neuron, MOA, and result}}

![](https://i.imgur.com/mbXmr7u.jpg)

- Some SSRI can inhibit NE uptake and stimulate 5-HTR = synergistic effect, raise pain threshold

{{substantia gelatinosa histology}}

- substantia gelatinosa

![](https://i.imgur.com/6ykcPYX.png)



![](https://i.imgur.com/WScrqCC.jpg)

- light area: high concentration of enkephalinergic neurons

{{cannabinoids function and MOA}}

{{limbic system and pain pathway}}

![](https://i.imgur.com/v1ZjXMn.jpg)

- People in fight or flight  don't feel pain until later
- also present in kids before getting shots. Thus really complicated system

# Pain

{{what is psychosomatic pain. 2 defective pathways. Why is it linked to depression. Example disease. Drug used to treat and MOA}}

![](https://i.imgur.com/OGoH5jz.jpg)

- mood disorder co present with lower pain threshold

{{what is neuropathic pain. Examples. Surgical treatment}}

![](https://i.imgur.com/QMZzLfI.jpg)

- ignore MS, diabetic neuropathy, V/IX neuralgias

# Placebo

{{Placebo effect cause, pathway, result}}

![](https://i.imgur.com/03CWlRe.jpg)

- begins with primary senses, info relayed to reward center, inform PAG to elevate descending system

# Nocebo

# Visceral Pain

![](https://i.imgur.com/vKVWShy.jpg)

- ALS does not control visceral pain. 
- Visceral lumbar/abdominal 1 afferent synapse at lower level of dorsal horn and ascenda via PDCN in FG
